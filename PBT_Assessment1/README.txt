To Ahsan,

I am aware of what a middleware is and what it performs. It basically acts as a bridge for applications 
to provide unified services to users. That said I was not able to get a middleware to work such as RabbitMQ. 
However, I was aware that a network is required, and since this prototype required using a database 
to store information for orders and trades, I used XAMPP to run Apache to create a local server and SQL to create the database. 

Unfortunately I could not incorporate a middleware and I could not find a tutorial for it that was helpful to my own understanding. 
However, I will try to research more about it and get it to perform correctly in Assessment 3. I apologise for not being able to 
incorporate a middleware and I hope that I demonstrated some of my understanding through making a network using XAMPP.
